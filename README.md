# 4D Flow MRI Flow Assessment
The goal of this project is to post process the 4D Flow MRI image files of the 3D printed tricuspid valve of the aorta to extract the Pixel Magnitude and Velocity Magnitude of the inflow and outflow of the valve. This file consists of the following sections:

- [Dataset](#dataset)
- [Segmentation](#segmentation)
- [Data Projection](#data-projection)
- [Results](#results)

## Dataset
The dataset was shared with our group from the collabolator at UofT and Sickkids hospital of Toronto, Dr. Christopher Macgowan. The dataset consists of the Dicom files of 4D flow MRI of a 3D printed valve. The dataset was processed by Arman Aghaee, Ph.D. Candidate at CIMBL Lab at Toronto Metropolitan University, the data was shared with me in VTK format. The goal of this project was to extract the pixel magnitude and flow along the time to validate the processing step.
